# About us

Digital Diceworks is a small development team that is currently working towards
the standarization of a virtual reality movement system.  Our aim is to create
a quality gaming experience that not only solves the discomfort of full motion
systems but that is complete and fulfilling.

"Hello my name is Carlos Molina and I am the Studio Lead for Digital Diceworks. Since we are a small team, I am also the Game Designer/3D Artist/The Man of Many Hats/Not a Programmer. I designed the Natural Locomotion system as an answer for the need to create a VR motion system that doesn't cause players discomfort but gives the freedom to explore without breaking immersion"
