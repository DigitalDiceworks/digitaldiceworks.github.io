  <h5>What is Natural Locomotion?</h5>
</center>
<h4>
  Natural Locomotion (NLM) is a movement system designed for use within
  Virtual Reality environments.  The concepts behind the NLM system are derived
  from observing the natural motions we all take when moving around in real life.
<br>
<br>
  Imagine that you're holding a VR controller close to your body, while keeping
  your arm tucked against your body start moving as if you were going to take a
  small step forward.  In that motion, notice that the controller has moved from
  its original position and along the same direction that you took your step.
  With this information, our NLM system translates your motions directly into
  virtual space.

  <h5>How is this different from what's currently being used?</h5>

​<h4>
  One of the biggest challenges when incorporating a free movement type system
  is avoiding discomfort for the player using it.  Current systems that avoid
  discomfort, such as the widely used Teleport, manage to reduce discomfort but
  also tends to break immersion for players.  There are "walk in place" systems
  that can also reduce discomfort but require a fair amount of mobility to use
  and lack precision when using them at lower speeds.  Lastly there is the Full
  Locomotion system where the player uses either a joystick or a touchpad as
  you would in regular video games but in virtual reality instead.  While this
  system is gaining popularity, it comes with a high wall of discomfort for
  many users.  Given enough exposure you might reduce your discomfort but it is
  not guaranteed and the adjustment period is rarely short.
<br>
<br>
  Natural Locomotion is designed in a way to avoid discomfort and has an
  adjustment period that is extremely short to none at all.  Part  of the
  reason discomfort occurs is due to the player's virtual body moving while
  they are not at all.  This disconnect of the real body to the virtual body
  leaves the player expecting to feel motion when none is occurring, resulting
  in discomfort.  Since the NLM system is having the player incorporate body
  movement into its use, the player is connecting with their virtual body in a
  way that avoids discomfort.

  <h5>Where can I try Natural Locmotion?</h5>
</center>
<h4>
  Natural Locomotion is still in active development.  As we continue to improve
  and expand the system we have made available a series of demo's that showcase
  the system (available below).  We are also releasing the source code on
  GitHub to make it available for not only others to use but also contribute
  towards.
</h4>
<center>
  <h5>Wait....why would you make this system open-source?</h5>
</center>
<h4>
  The reason we designed the Natural Locomotion system was to make a
  standardized motion system that would expand what we can do in all virtual
  reality experiences. We want other developers to use and expand on the NLM
  system's capabilities so that virtual reality can continue to push forward in
  large strides.

  <h5>When are you going to release your own games?</h5>
</center>
<h4>
  Indeed we are game developers. We are currently in the middle of getting
  funding together so we can start our company and expanding our team to bring
  you the best gaming experiences we can make. The first of which is going to
  be a Ninja Stealth game currently called Ninja Ops: Twilight Chronicles
  (working title). We hope to bring you this title as soon as possible and that
  you keep following us for updates.
