      "Hello my name is Carlos Molina and I am the Studio Lead for Digital Diceworks.
      Since we are a small team, I am also the Game Designer/3D Artist/The Man of
      Many Hats/Not a Programmer. I designed the Natural Locomotion system as an
      answer for the need to create a VR motion system that doesn't cause players
      discomfort but gives the freedom to explore without breaking immersion"
